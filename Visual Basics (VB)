Introduction
First released in 1991, Visual Basic is an event-driven programming language from Microsoft.
VB is built upon BASIC, and it was aimed to help user produce GUI (graphical user interface) 
applications with ease (which was groundbreaking at the time).
Compared with other languages such as C and C++, VB is a visual development tool that’s easier to learn, although it might be slower to write with, yet more flexible. 
Many would argue that Visual Basics went into decline after VB6, though VB.NET (object-oriented, updated version of VB6) remains the fifth most-popular programming language as of today. Nevertheless, VB.NET is slowly being replaced by its modern peer, C#, but it’s still a starting point for a lot of beginners. 

Code Example (In VB.NET):
Module HelloWorld
   ' every console app starts with Main
      Sub Main( )
         System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World")
      End Sub
   End Module
