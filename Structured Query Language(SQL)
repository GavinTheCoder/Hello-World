# Structured Query Language
	Structured Query Language(SQL) is a database management system, 
  that creates a table, you can also insert data to it, to make a list, like a grocery list.
  It was born in 1970s, at that time, it was called SEQUEL then (Structured English Query Language).
	I can’t do a “hello world” example, but I’m going to use a list to show you.


[———-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]
[	CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, quantity INTEGER ); ]
[                                                                                ]
[	INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4);                                ]
[	INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1);                          ]
[	INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (3, "Dark chocolate bars", 2);                    ]
[———-----------------------------------------------------------------------------]


This is an example of a groceries list:
First create a table named groceries that has: 
	an ID (which is a integer and it’s a primary key)
	a  name(which is a text)
	and a quantity(which is another integer)

CREATE TABLE groceries (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, 			quantity INTEGER );


And this will appear:

Picture of groceries list:








And add in to the list:
	bananas:
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (1, "Bananas", 4);






Picture:




	peanut butter:
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (2, "Peanut Butter", 1);


Picture:




	Dark chocolate bars:
INSERT INTO groceries VALUES (3, "Dark chocolate bars", 2);



Picture:






Now:
Click at the name of list or type:
Select * FROM groceries;
The * means ALL (things)



My experience is:
	it’s very good for list, but that’s it, it also can’t be connected with Java or HTML or other programing languages, even dough, I think it’s still very indeed good!
