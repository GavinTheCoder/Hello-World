# Develop a template as such:

  ## For each programming language, make sure you have --
1.  A Brief Introduction (Time when it's published, Specialty, Popularity, etc.)
2.  A short example of the code (Hello world/For Loop)
3.  Your personal experience with the language (if any)

  ##Then have a individual file that cross-compares these languages (Specialty, DOB, Popularity, Simple code example)
* As a challenge, Try to find an image that best-represents each language

Good luck!
